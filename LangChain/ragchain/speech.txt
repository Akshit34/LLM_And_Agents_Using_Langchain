Democracy is a Greek word that means "people" and "rules."
It allows people to choose their own government. 
Greece was the world's first democratic country.
India is also a democratic country where people elect their government and have the freedom to choose their work. 
Democracy can be direct, representative, or hybrid (semi-direct). 
Many decisions are made in democracies, and people are given certain rights essential for living a happy life.

Our country has the largest democracy. In a democracy, each person has equal rights to fight for development. After the independence, India has adopted democracy, where the people vote those who are above 18 years of age, but these votes do not vary by any caste; people from every caste have equal rights to select their government. Democracy, also called as a rule of the majority, means whatever the majority of people decide, it has to be followed or implemented, the representative winning with the most number of votes will have the power. We can say the place where literacy people are more there shows the success of the democracy even lack of consciousness is also dangerous in a democracy. Democracy is associated with higher human accumulation and higher economic freedom. Democracy is closely tied with the economic source of growth like education and quality of life as well as health care. The constituent assembly in India was adopted by Dr B.R. Ambedkar on 26th November 1949 and became sovereign democratic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950.
